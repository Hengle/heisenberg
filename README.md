**heisenberg** is a simple plot creator, buncled with a couple of instruction to try and shed a little light on "heisenberg's uncertainty principle".

# How it works:

**1)** As soon as it opens up, you will be able to do 3 things:
	Press (+) to create a new plot;
	Press (H) to open up a simple explanation with examples;
	Slide the dot at the top-right corner of the screen to change the number of measures of each plot;

**2)** If you choose (+) you will be asked to provide a standard deviation and a mean for any of the 3 graphs:

	- A(k) represents 
	- Re(<div>&Psi</div>(x)) represents
	- |<div>&Psi</div>(x)|^2 represents

**3)** If you choose (H) a screen like below will popup (the explanation is currently in Portuguese):

# Scaling:

All the scaling is done independently on each type of graph (not on each graph!) and automatically. According to the user-provided value for the standard deviance, an "interesting" range of values is calculated and only that range will be ploted.
To give a simple example of all this, here is a screenshot with 3 different values of standard deviation and, for each of those values, all three types of graph are plotted in a row.

# Other features:

**1)** You can close a graph by clicking the button at its top left corner.
**2)** You can freely move any graph by clicking on top of it and dragging.
